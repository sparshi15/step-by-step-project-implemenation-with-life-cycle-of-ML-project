🔄 Step-by-Step Implementation of ML Project Lifecycle
🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow—from initial data analysis to model training and evaluation—using regression techniques like Linear, Multiple Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression on structured datasets.

🚀 Running the Project
bash
git clone https://github.com/sparshi15/step-by-step-project-implemenation-with-life-cycle-of-ML-project.git
cd step-by-step-project-implemenation-with-life-cycle-of-ML-project
pip install -r requirements.txt  # optional: include if created
python src/application.py        # placeholder for script execution
🔍 Results & Insights
Regression models compared across different feature sets

Observed trade-offs between bias and variance in regularized models

Saved models for future deployment or reuse

🌟 Next Steps
Add experiment tracking with MLflow or TensorBoard

Integrate .yml for reproducible environment setup

Deploy with Streamlit or Flask
